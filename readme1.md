Introduction of JavaScript

-----------------------------

JavaScript is an open-source programming language designed for creating web-centric applications. It is lightweight and interpreted which makes it much faster than other languages and is integrated with HTML making it easier to implement in web applications.

Key Features of JavaScript

------------------------------

1. ## Case - Sensitive.

   Case Sensitive Format. The codes written in Java Script are Case Sensitive which explains that there will be no difference in the output whether the codes
   Case Sensitive. In Javascript, names, variables, keywords, and functions are case-sensitive.

2. ## Client Side Validation.

((Client-side Validations. Javascript client-side validations allow users to submit valid data to the server during a form submission.))

3. ## Interpreter.

(( Interpreter Based. JavaScript is an interpreted language instead of a compiled one. In that sense, it is closer to languages like Ruby and Python. ))


4. ## Dynamic Typing.

Dynamic Typing. One of the main features of JavaScript is its dynamic typing system. This means that variables can hold any type of data, regardless of what Dynamic Typing. Javascript variables can have any value type. The same variable can have a string value, an integer value, or any other.


5. ## Platform Independent.

Platform Independent. Since programs interpret JavaScript, it takes care of the issue of accumulation and similarity. Hence it can run on Windows, Macintosh Platform Independent. Javascript will run in the same way in all systems with any operating system.

6. ## Event Handling.

Event Handling. JavaScript allows you to handle the events used to interact with the web page. For example, you can detect the mouse click on a particular Event Handling. Events are actions. Javascript provides event-handling options.

7. ## Light Weight.

Light Weight. JavaScript isn't a compiled language, so it doesn't get converted to byte-code beforehand. However, it does follow a paradigm called Just-In Light Weight. As Javascript is not a compiled language, source code never changes to byte code before running time. Low-end devices can also run Javascript Java Script Features Light Weight and delicate and codes written in JavaScript don't include variables and uses only objects to perform the operations.


Do's ✅ & Don'ts ❌ in JavaScript
------------------------------------

✅Avoid Global Variables. Minimize the use of global variables
❌ Never use of var

✅Always Declare Local Variables
❌ Instead of Variables that used in outside of loops , functions ....

✅Declarations on Top
❌ instead of using variables here and there bootom or middle 

✅Initialize Variables
❌Instead of updation and re-declaration

✅Declare Objects with const
❌ Instead of let and var storing data in Objects 

✅Declare Arrays with const
❌  Instead of let and var for storing data in Arrays

✅Don't Use new Object() 
❌ dont Use new Objects() to storing data 

✅Beware of Automatic Type Conversions
❌ Instead of putting your brain. Use Emmet Abbreviation


 Recongnising the Syntax
-------------------------


for String () 

for Arrays []

for Objects {}

for objects inside  the Strings ({}) // it is strings....

for Arrays inside the  strings ([]) // it is Strings....

for strings inside the  Arrays [()] // it is array....

for Objects inside the Arrays [{}] // it is Array....

for Strings inside the Objects {()} // it is Objects....

for Arrays  inside the Objects {[]}  // it is objects....


Data Types in JavaScript
-------------------------


1) Primitive Data-Types               |       2) Reference Data-Types
________________________              |       _________________________
a) int                                |       a) Objects {}
b) Boolean                            |
c) BigInt                             |     
d) Null                               |       b) Arrays []
e) NaN                                |       
f) strings                            |
g) Undefined                          |       c) Functions (())
h) Numbers                            |




Summary: Uses of {}  []  () it means Reference Data-Types Comes
         Other-wise all Data-Types are PrimitiveData-Types except of Objects,
         Functions & Arrays.
